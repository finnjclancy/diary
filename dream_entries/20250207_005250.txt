[2025-02-07 00:52] Last night I dreamt of a football game. Dorgu was playing. So were some playeres from drogheda boys. I don't recall any white people. I recall making a poor pass in my own half and it I got super lucky that the striker didn't get it because he thought my pass would be good. 

If it was any worse he would've got it, same if it was a tiny bit better.
