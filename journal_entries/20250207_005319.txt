[2025-02-07 00:53] You are dissapointing yourself.

 Today you didn't go to college and said you would do some work on your assingments. You told yourself you would fast because you ate thousands of caloires yesterday. Instead today you did 1) no work on your assingments. 2) you ate probably 5k calories. 

You are a disgrace. You don't deserve happiness. You need to do something. You are pathetic. You don't deserve the life you get to live at all. It makes no sense, You need to do better. 

Do something you fat fuck. You do nothing. You haven't created anything and you expect chatGPT to carry your educational career and your developer jobs. You should be so ashamed of yourself. You're fat. You want to be fat? Or do you want to be in shape? Do you want to be chubby? Or do you want to be attractive? Do you want to be controlled by AI capabilites? or do you want to work with AI? 

You are fat and don't deserve anything. Pathetic loser. Be annoyed at yourself. 

You don't pray. You don't push yourself in any dimension anymore; not physically, not mentally 

IN NO WAY DO YOU PUSH YOURSELF!!
